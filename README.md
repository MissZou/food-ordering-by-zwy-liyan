Dissertation in HKU. Developing a food ordering system which is a copycat of [ele](https://www.ele.me/) and [Meituan waimai](http://waimai.meituan.com/).

Front-end: iOS native App, PC and mobile web page. 
Back-end: Node.js + mongodb.

**LoginViewController.m**
- (IBAction)loginButtonClicked:(id)sender
